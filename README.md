# 🧠 Console-Based Python Quiz App

This is a beginner-friendly quiz application developed in Python.  
The quiz runs in the terminal and presents users with 5 multiple-choice questions.  
It is designed to demonstrate essential Python concepts like functions, conditionals, loops, lists, tuples, and user input handling — all in one simple project.



## 📌 Project Overview

- Asks one question at a time
- Takes input from the user for each question
- Validates the answer and gives immediate feedback
- Tracks the user’s score throughout the quiz
- Displays final score and a message based on performance
- Includes input error handling and clean structure using functions



## 💡 Key Features

✅ **Interactive Design**  
Users receive feedback after each question (correct/wrong), and a summary at the end.

📋 **Question Management**  
Questions and correct answers are stored in a `list of tuples`.  
Options for each question are stored in a `list of lists`.

🔁 **One-by-One Question Flow**  
The quiz shows **one question at a time** and takes user input before moving to the next.

🧠 **Score Tracking and Feedback**  
The app keeps track of the correct answers and shows:
 Final score
 A message like:
"Excellent",  
 "Good job",  
 or "Needs improvement"

🔐 **Input Validation & Error Handling**  
Ensures the user enters only valid choices (A/B/C/D). If not, it prompts again without crashing.

🔧 **Python Concepts Used**
 Functions (`check_answer`)
 Variables & Boolean logic
  Lists & Tuples
 `if-else` conditions
 `for` and `while` loops
 `input()` and `.strip().upper()` for clean input handling
